[h1]Overview[/h1]
Do you love consecrating worlds?  Do you want [i]more[/i] consecrated worlds?  Then this mod is for you!

When the game starts, you (or the host, for multiplayer) will be asked what the maximum number of consecrated worlds (per empire with the "Consecrated Worlds" ascension perk).  The game's default setting is 3, but it can be set from 1 to 10 or unlimited.  The Consecrated World Worship modifier dynamically scales based on the combined levels of all your consecrated worlds.

This mod also improves the chances for your empire to get better consecration modifiers if you are predisposed to some planet types. Origin: Post-Apocalyptic, Civic: Memorialists (all versions), and empires whose main species prefer Tomb Worlds gain improved chances for Tomb Worlds (stackable). Memorialists also gain improved chances for Relic Worlds. Origin: Ocean Paradise and Hydrocentric empires gain improved chances for Ocean Worlds (stackable). Finally, Origin: Teachers of the Shroud and empires that have adopted the Psionics traditions gain improved chances on Shrouded Worlds (stackable).

[h2]Localisation[/h2]
Almost all text altered by this mod is localised into eight of the languages supported by Stellaris.  However, the beginning-of-the-game event's description and "default" option are only available in English.  If you would like to supply a translation for one or more languages, please contact me via Steam or leave a comment.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
When consecrating or deconsecrating a world, the game dynamically calculates the correct bonus for Consecrated World Worship.  In order to accomplish this, it was necessary to overwrite an effect ([b]recalculate_consecrated_world_modifier[/b]) and the decisions ([b]decision_consecrated_worlds[/b] and [b]decision_unconsecrated_worlds[/b]) as well as preempt the events ([b]mega.100[/b] and [b]mega.110[/b]) that deal with consecration.

The Consecrated Worlds Worship modifier is now applied via a dynamic multiplier and can now scale infinitely instead of capping out at a total of twelve "levels" of Consecrated Worlds Worship.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
While this mod does replace some built-in gameplay objects, it should generally play nicely with other mods as long a they do not also adjust Consecrated Worlds.

Not included in my compilation mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522974089]Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements[/url].  This mod is compatible with the compilation.

Built for Stellaris version 3.7 "Canis Minor."  Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be safely added after the game has started and should be safe to remove.  After removing the mod, your game will revert to the built-in behavior for Consecrated Worlds (although you will not lose any if you exceed the base cap of 3).  Always backup your savegame before attempting to remove a mod.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
Overwriting effects and planetary decisions a well as preempting events result in the game logging error messages when first launching.  Expect to see five lines in error.log similar to these:
