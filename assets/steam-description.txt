[h1]Overview[/h1]

Do you love consecrating worlds?  Do you want [i]more[/i] consecrated worlds?  Then this mod is for you!

When the game starts, you (or the host, for multiplayer) will be asked what the maximum number of consecrated worlds (per empire with the "Consecrated Worlds" ascension perk).  The game's default setting is 3, but it can be set from 1 to 10 or unlimited.  The Consecrated World Worship modifier dynamically scales based on the combined levels of all your consecrated worlds.

Additionally, consecrating a world spawns the Divine Enforcer planet effects - a little graphical bonus to make the process a little prettier.  The Consecrated World modifiers now also cause planets to show their nameplates and thus be a little easier to pick them out when in the systemview.

[h2]Localisation[/h2]

Almost all text altered by this mod is localised into all eight languages supported by Stellaris.  However, the beginning-of-the-game event's description and "default" option are only available in English.  If you would like to supply a translation for one or more languages, please contact me via Steam or leave a comment.

[h1]Changes[/h1]

When consecrating or deconsecrating a world, the game dynamically calculates the correct bonus for Consecrated World Worship.  In order to accomplish this, it wa necessary to overwrite an effect ([b]recalculate_consecrated_world_modifier[/b]) and the decisions ([b]decision_consecrated_worlds[/b] and [b]decision_unconsecrated_worlds[/b]) as well as preempt the events ([b]mega.100[/b] and [b]mega.110[/b]) that deal with consecration.

The Consecrated Worlds Worship modifier is now applied via a dynamic multiplier and can now scale infinitely instead of capping out at a total of twelve "levels" of Consecrated Worlds Worship.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

Overwriting effects and planetary decisions a well as preempting events result in the game logging error messages when first launching.  Expect to see five lines in error.log similar to these:
